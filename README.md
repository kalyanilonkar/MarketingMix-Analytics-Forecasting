This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project analyzing the impact of marketing activities (TV ads, online banners, and in-store promotions) on chocolate sales across multiple countries. It includes extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, time series forecasting, PCA, multiple regression models, and marketing effectiveness evaluation.

##  Project Objectives

- **Assess** the contribution of marketing activities on sales across Mexico, Spain, US, UK, and Singapore.
- **Build forecasting models** (Linear Trend, Naive Seasonal, ARIMA) to predict future sales.
- **Apply PCA** to reduce dimensionality and analyze key drivers of sales.
- **Develop regression models** to understand and quantify the impact of marketing activities.
- **Calculate ROI & cost-effectiveness** of different marketing channels.

## Example Insights

- **TV advertising** contributed the highest units sold across most regions.
- **Singapore** showed strong seasonality captured by STL, while Mexico had a clearer upward trend.
- PCA reduced dimensionality to 3-4 components explaining ~80% variance.
- Regression models found **TV ads, online banners, and promotions significant**, with positive ROI on TV ads but much higher cost-effectiveness on banners.
